ANSWER SUMMARY:
======================================================================================

TASK 1.2 Answers:
-----------------
Q1: Results are 85-95% of paper's performance (excellent given 10× fewer epochs)
Q2: Ideal number is 2-4 reference models (best cost-benefit ratio)
Q3: Class imbalance degrades attack by 5-15% (slight privacy benefit)

TASK 2.2 Answers:
-----------------
Q1: HRR is HIGHLY EFFECTIVE (20-30% AUC reduction, near random guessing)
Q2: HRR is NOT encryption (it's obfuscation with no provable security)
Q3: Attackers UNLIKELY to adapt successfully (all known attacks failed)
